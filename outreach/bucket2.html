                                    <p>LISD Convocation is an event held in early August to kick-start the Leander Independent School District School Year. Itâ€™s an event that hosts over 6,000 LISD employees from all over the entire district. By attending and demonstrating our brand new FRC Steamworks Off-Season robot, we were able to expose teachers, custodians, food service workers, bus drivers, and many more to the extended programs within FIRST. We were honored when we were asked to demo our robot as this was an incredible opportunity to show Leander ISD what we had been working so diligently on during the summer.</p>

                                    <p>Valor got in contact with LEEF (Leander Education Excellence Foundation) and were given the opportunity to create a foam machine and host a showcase booth for the event. For the past 2 years Valor has sponsored and attended the LEEF Mudstacle. This event was a dual fundraiser and fun-run event for people of all ages. Members of Valor were asked to create a foam machine for the beginning and end of the fun run course in order to add more character and amusement to the event. With LEEF, we were able to reach over 3,500 students and parents from all across LISD to talk about and spread the message of FIRST while also getting parents and student interested and involved in STEM/ From the Mudstacle event alone, LEEF and its event volunteers were able to raise $68,000 to support LISD programs for the economically disadvantaged.</p>

                                    <p>The Texas Robot Round Up (TRR) is a off-season competition that was started by the ausTIN CANs (2158) in 2011. At first, the event was held at Anderson high school, and then as more and more teams wanted to compete, the event eventually moved to the Austin Convention Center during UIL Week. Last year, UIL decided to become more involved in robotics and decided to create the UIL State Championships during UIL week. Problematically, TRR was without a venue and Anderson high school was unable to host the event at their school. Hearing about this, Valor knew that there was only one course of action. Valor extended a helping hand and offered their high school facilities to the ausTIN CANs in order to keep the fun annual off-season event going.</p>

                                    <p>In 2017, Valor organized the FTC Central Texas Kickoff for a grand total of 36 teams to enjoy before the 2017-2018 Relic Recovery game was released. In the morning we ran our selected 10 team bonding games to serve as ice breakers and give all teams opportunity to meet others. Following suit, we ran 8 workshops for all rookie teams and rookie students so they could start their season off with a good foundation of knowledge for the FTC process and all it involves. These workshops included: Marketing Strategies/Business & Engineering Notebook, Hardware (Basic), Hardware (Advanced), and Programming (Java).
                                    In 2018, Valor also hosed this years FTC game reveal/kickoff with 40 teams for the 2018-2019 Rover Ruckus game. Before revealing the game we directed all of the teams through team bonding games for teams to have fun. We then projected the game reveal and broke for lunch allowing for teams to begin strategizing. Following the break Valor ran 7 workshops for teams to divide into based on what they would like to focus on. The 7 workshops covered: Marketing Strategies/Business, Engineering Notebook, Intro to hardware, Advanced Hardware, Intro to Programming, Advanced programming, Intro to CAD, Advanced CAD, and Strategy.</p>

                                    <p>For the FTC Texas Alamo Regional, we set up arenas and judging rooms while also running the volunteer registration table the night before competition to ensure a steady event the following day. Additionally, we had several members volunteering until 9 pm that Friday night as Pit Admin and guides to get teams through the building. The day of competition, our team volunteered as pit queuers This meant that we had people in all areas of the competition; some ran back and forth while others made sure that team were early for matches. By having members of Valor volunteer in addition to the loyal volunteers of FIRST events, the FTC Alamo Regional was able to run smoothly and according to schedule.</p>

This way parents can see the what their students have been working on the past six weeks. This also lets sponsors see what their hard earned dollars go to. Each sub-team in Valor gives a presentation on their specific part of the robot or team. Valor hosted its very first open house this year. We had 70 guests that were a mix of parents, sponsors, and even prospective students that were interested in joining Valor.</p>

                                    <p>At FRC kickoff, Valorâ€™s coach taught a workshop on reliable and robust autonomous. This workshop was based on the autonomous we tested during our off-season build session. We were able to help teams by explaining the mistakes we made during our testing and share how we were able to create a successful autonomous in a short amount of time. This workshop was focused on our use of sensors, state machines, and CSV files- all core parts of our software platform. Even though we are a rookie team, we quickly found that our autonomous programming scheme was effective and easy to implement for almost any team with limited experience. Our kickoff workshop was built off of this realization had helped some teams like Lady Cans #2881 better implement sensors into their autonomous programs.</p>

                                    <p>Valor hosted FTC rookie camp at Vandegrift High School for the Viperbots teams. It is a week long camp held during the summer. We had multiple workshops for the different sub teams to show them the fundamentals of their role. We had mock judging sessions, hardware presentations, introduction to marketing presentations, and introduction to software presentations. At the end of the week, we had a mock competition where the rookies would compete with the robots that they had built during the week. It gave the rookies a basic idea of what a real competition would be like later in the season.</p>

Every Tuesday and Thursday, Valor would act as mentors and help these FLL teams with any issues they had during their design process/ build time. We also invited these kids to attend the Texas Robot Round-Up so they could experience a full FRC tournament. After these events, we would demonstrate the various functions of our robot and give the FLL students a tour of our machine in hopes of inspiring the kids to continue with FIRST robotics.</p>
